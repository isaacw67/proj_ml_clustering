# proj_ml_clustering

We have a few different folders and files here:

world_cloud is a directory containing the images to the 10 word clouds I made for each cluster.

cluster_experiments.ipynd is a Jupyter notebook file with the code for the project. 

docsclust_image is the image yielded by the dendrogram drawing function.

index.html is the html file for a website that produces a map based on my 10 clusters. I DO NOT HAVE A WEBSITE TO HOST THIS!

Vocab is a csv file that stores the words associated with each attribute. 

and finally, Mini Project 2 Write-Up is a brief write-up of what we found in the project.
